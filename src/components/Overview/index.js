          <strong>November</strong> is one of the **best times** to visit Kenya, especially to experience the breathtaking **Maasai Mara**.  
          This is because the **large migratory herds** have returned to Tanzania, forcing the **Big Cats** to roam longer distances in search of prey.

        <p className="overview-text">
          November also marks the **season of short rains**, turning the Maasai Mara plains into a **lush green paradise**.  
          The skies are dramatic, **bursting with colors**, making **sunrises and sunsets** truly mesmerizing.
